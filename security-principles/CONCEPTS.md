| Availability   | Refers to the property of being accessible and usable upon request by an authorized entity.     |
| Authenticity   | Refers to the property of being genuine and trustworthy. It ensures that data is not tampered with or altered. |
| Confidentiality | Refers to the property of being private and kept secret. It ensures that data is only accessible to authorized entities. |
| Non-repudiation   |is a security concept that ensures that an individual or entity cannot deny having taken a particular action. In the context of digital communication, it means that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent it, and the recipient of a message cannot deny having received it.    |

## Authentication
Here we have some examples of common methods of authentication:
- **Something you know**: Password or paraphrases (The most insecure auth method)
- **Something you have**: Tokens, memory cards, smart cards;
- **Something you are**: Biometrics, measurable characteristics, fingerprints, voice, iris patterns;

## Methods of Authentication
Two types of authentication methods:
- __Single-factor authentication (SFA)__: Single-factor authentication (SFA) is a security process that requires users to provide only one type of identification method to verify their identity. 
- __Multi-factor authentication (MFA)__: requires users to provide multiple forms of identification to verify their identity, adding an extra layer of security to the authentication process.
