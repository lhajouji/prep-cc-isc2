- Immediate response procedures and checklists (security and safety procedures, fire suppression procedures, - notification of appropriate emergency-response agencies, etc.)
- Notification systems and call trees for alerting personnel that the BCP is being enacted
- Guidance for management, including designation of authority for specific managers
