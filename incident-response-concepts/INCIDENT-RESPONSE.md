# Incident Response: concepts & step-by-step
- **Which is the primary goal of Incident Response?** The priority of any incident response is to protect life, health and safety. When any decision related to priorities is to be made, always choose safety first.

- **How it works?** The Incidente Response Plan is composed of four parts:

    | Component | Example  |
    | --- | --- |
    | Preparation | Develop a policy approved by management, Identify critical data and systems and any single points of failure, Train staff on incident response.  |
    | Detection and Analysis | Monitor all possible attack vectors, Analyze incident using known data and threat intelligence, Standardize incident documentation, Prioritize incident response  |
    | Contaiment, eradication and recovery |  Isolate the attack, Identify the attacker, Choose an appropriate containment strategy, Gather evidence |
    | Post-Incident Activity | Identify evidence that may need to be retained, Document lessons learned, Retrospective (preparation, Detection, containment, Post-Incident)|

- **What does an incident response team do?** 
    - Determine the amount and scope of damage caused by the incident.
    - Determine whether any confidential information was compromised during the incident.
    - Implement any necessary recovery procedures to restore security and recover from incident-related damage.
    - Supervise the implementation of any additional security measures necessary to improve security and prevent recurrence of the incident.
